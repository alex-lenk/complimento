        <h1>About Us</h1>

        <p>You know you’re destined to be a fashion designer if you: a) spent most of your childhood making clothes for
            your Barbie dolls instead of playing with your friends; b) read fashion magazines instead of your school
            books; c) ran a boutique out of your basement at age 10. In other words: if you want to be the next Yves
            Saint Laurent, it helps to be completely and utterly obsessed with fashion.</p>

        <p>However, there are many aspects of the profession. Working as a fashion designer can just as well mean
            supervising a design team at a sportswear company as producing a label under your own name. Although the
            former career may not seem as glamorous as the latter, it certainly will make your life less stressful. To
            create your own label takes a lot of time, dedication and hard work. Not to mention living just above the
            poverty line for several years.</p>

        <p>Choosing a strategy</p>

        <p>There are as many different ways to embark upon a fashion career as there are styles of design. Ralph
            Lauren’s Polo empire was founded on a small tie collection that he sold to Bloomingdales. Helmut Lang
            decided to open his own clothing store when he couldn’t find a t-shirt that he liked. Michael Kors built up
            a network of customers by selling clothes in a trendy NYC boutique.</p>
